## Development

We're using Jekyll to generate static HTML from Markdown. 

### Setup

Jekyll suggests that you not rely on the default Ruby install,
and instead [install Ruby with Homebrew](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/),
and then `gem install jekyll`.

### PRs and Reviews

All changes should be made through PRs, and PRs should have one approving review before merge.

Branch names should begin with the number of the issue addressed, followed by a brief description.
